# Flash-drive “Shortcut Virus” fix

A c++ version of windows batch commands to fix shortcut virus in thumb drives

*Disclaimer: First understand the program before executing it for it may cause damage to your files if used carelessly and the developer won’t be responsible for it.*

My AntiVirus Project (repository available on main page) contains a module named Fix Shortcut. I find this module particularly interesting because it executes a batch file and performs the given operations on the chosen drive and fixes the shortcut links corrupted by a shortcut worm in real time. A batch file is a file in windows which contains a sequence of command line operations to be executed on the command window.

In this repository with a single program, I have shown how we can write and execute batch programs in C++ and interact with windows operating system using simple inbuilt functions.
